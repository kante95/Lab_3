\chapter{System stability analysis and Logic circuits}
In this experience we firstly realised a stable Wien bridge oscillator and then some logic circuits to help us with some 'academic' problems.

\section{Materials}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparator $\mu$A741
\item Thermoresistor PT100
\item Resistors, trimmers, capacitors
\item Power supply RIGOL DP831A
\item Multimeter RIGOL DM3068
\end{itemize}
The resistors used were all with an uncertainty of 5\%
