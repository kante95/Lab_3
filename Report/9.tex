\chapter{Wien bridge oscillator and digital electronic}
In the first part ogf the experience we built a wien bridge oscillator with an automatic gain control so the oscillation is automatic controlled. We focused our attention on the wave's quality and the critical time of startup. The second part was about digital electronics, after we got confident with a NAND port we designed a circuit for an house alarm system.
\section{Materials}
\begin{itemize}
\item Operational amplifiers $\mu$A741
