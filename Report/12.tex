\chapter{ADC tracking}
In this experience we built an ADC with a resolution of around 1 over 256, going from 0 to almost 5V.

\section{Materials}
\begin{itemize}
\item Operational amplifiers OP07
\item Instrumentation amplifier (INA) AD622
\item Precision +5V Voltage Reference REF02
\item Resistors, trimmers
\item Power supply RIGOL DP831A
\item Waveform generator RIGOL DG1032
\item Multimeter RIGOL DM3068
\item NAND 74LS00
\item NOT 74LS04
\item 74LS109 
\end{itemize}
The resistors used were all with an uncertainty of 5\%

\section{Experimental setup}
We used the circuit of the counter of the previous experience and we connected it to the DAC08. We selected an input current in the pin VR+ of 2mA, this was done by using a power supply of 4.4V and resistor of 2.2k$\Ohm$. We verified the value of output current was according to the table XX by changing the bits of the counter and The output was connected with ground with a 2k$\Ohm$ resistor and with a comparator that compares the signal we want to follow. The comparator is used to determine if the signal is too low of high by enabling or diabling the D-FF.
