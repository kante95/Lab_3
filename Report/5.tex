\chapter{A new device: the comparator}
We can use an op-amp to compare two input signals: its output corresponds to a logic value (let's say 0) if $v_- > v_+$, to the other (1) in the opposite case. Verified this feature for two different op-amps, we build a Schmitt's trigger in order to adjust the comparator sensitivity and we try it in a twilight switch circuit.

\section{Experimental setup}
We have always powered the op-amps with a $\pm15$ V DC voltage and, in order to reduce possible noises, we added two capacitors to both op-amps pins for the power supply and the ground, one of 100nF and the other of 10nF (4 in total).\\
At first we used the UA741 as a comparator in order to build a relaxation oscillator producing a square wave from a capacitor charge and discharge: we chose $R_1 = R_2 = 10k\Omega$ and a 0.1 nF capacitor. The circuit (see figure ?) has been tested with 5 different values of R: 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 k$\Omega$ in order to have different periods and no imput signal was needed. A measure has been taken also setting the oscilloscope in single mode and then switching on the power supply.
We than tested the LM311 as both a non-invertent and an invertent comparator using $R_L = 1k\Omega$ and a triangular input signal of ? V and ? Hz.\\
Regarding the Schmitt's trigger, we added to the previous circuit the resistences $R_1 = 10 k\Omega$ and $R_2 = 100 \Omega$ in order to shift the reference voltage of a factor $\frac{1}{100}$ upward and downward and analyzed the behaviour at the point when $v_{in}\approx v_{ref}$.\\
At last, we built the twilight switch:\\
